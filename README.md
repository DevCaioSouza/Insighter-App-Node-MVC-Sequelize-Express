# Insighter - Your insight sharing social media
Insighter is nothing short of a pretty website where you can share your daily thoughts and inspire others.

I put a whole lot of love in this one, i wanted it to be a playground where i could explore the capabilities of<br>
MVC architecture based application. It has a server made with ExpressJS (NodeJS), a front-end page made with Handlebars
and the database is written in MySQL, with the addition of the ORM "Sequelize" to be an abstraction layer and provide proper
communication between the code and the Database. <br>
