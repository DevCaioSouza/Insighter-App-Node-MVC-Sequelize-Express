# Insighter - Your insight sharing social media
Insighter is nothing short of a pretty website where you can share your daily thoughts and inspire others.

I put a whole lot of love in this one, i wanted it to be a playground where i could explore the capabilities of a
MVC architecture based application. 

## Featuring:

 - The app was build with the use of NodeJS and Express libraries.
 - Its front-end was made using Handlebars (Template Engine), a library that allows html files to be written inside a backend folder structure. <br>
 - A database written in MySQL, with the addition of the ORM "Sequelize" to serve as an abstraction layer hence providing proper
communication between the code and the Database. <br>

## TO BE DONE

 - I still need to work on providing it a proper host, so everyone can have the experience that the app's supposed to provide.
